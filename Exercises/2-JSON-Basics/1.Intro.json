JSON is a simple, text-based way to store and transmit structured data. Once you've created your JSON string, it's easy to send it to another application or computer, because it's just plain text.

    -It's compact
    -It's easy for both computers and people to read and write
    -It maps very easily onto the data structures used by most programming languages (numbers, strings, booleans, nulls, arrays and associative arrays)
    -Nearly all programming languages contain functions or libraries that can read and write JSON structures
